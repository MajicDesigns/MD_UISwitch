\mainpage MD_UISwitch Library

This library uniformly encapsulates the use of different types of switches 
for user input devices. The library is easily extended for additional 
switch types through a class hierarchy and inheritance model, following 
the code for existing switch types.

The library includes the following features:
- Software debounce for all switch types.
- Automatically detect switch press, double press, long press and auto repeat.
- Can work with low/high or high/low transitions.
- All software timers are configurable for fine tuning to specific applications. These include:
 + debounce time.
 + double press time.
 + long press time.
 + auto repeat period time.

Switch arrangements handled by the library are:
- Momentary on type switches (MD_Switch_Digital class)
- User managed signals eg, I/O expanders (MD_Switch_User class)
- Analog resistor ladder switches (MD_Switch_Analog class)
- Keypad matrix (MD_Switch_Matrix class)
- Keypad matrix using 4017 IC (MD_Matrix_4017KM class)

*
* Using a 4017 IC, this class implements a method for reading many open/closed switches
* using only three digital I/O pins (Clock, Reset and DataIn). The class will scan a key 
* matrix that have circuits similar to that shown above. Pin numbers used are passed to 
* the class constructor allow the code to manage the 4017 IC to determine which key has 
* been pressed. Pins should be directly connected to the matrix without pull-up or 
* pull-down resistors.
*
* The class will only detect a key if there is just one key pressed. If more than one 
* key is pressed it will pause until just one key remains pressed.
